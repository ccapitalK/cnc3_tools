# cnc3_tools
This is a collection of tools I've written whilst exploring the game files of Command and Conquer 3. Included in this repository are:

# refpack.py
A python3 module for compressing and decompressing files using the EA refpack format (This basically just wraps the implementation in refpack/).

# big.py
A python3 module for creating/extracting EA big files.

# refpack/
Rust implementation of refpack compressor/decompressor. The compressor hasn't been implemented yet.
